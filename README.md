# Data-Exploration-using-Machine-Learning
Exploring the dataset, normalize the values and using the concepts such as label encoding and one-hot encoding


The dataset used here is - BigMarketSales

Here we try to understand the basics of machine learning while doing data exploration and analysis.

We will first try to understand the data-set and figure out our target column.

Now we will check if there are any null values present and to treat the null values we will replace those null values with the mean of that column for numerical values and with mode of that column for categorical values.

Now we will also explore some encodings such as label encoding and one-hot encoding.
